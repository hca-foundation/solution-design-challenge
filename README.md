# HCA Software Development Organization Microservice Architecture Challenge

## Overview
This development challenge is designed to evaluate your knowledge of a microservices application architecture. Some details are left vague for you to decide the best direction to take. If you have questions, please send them Cameron.Farmer@hcahealthcare.com so we can address them.

## Introduction
You have been tasked with designing and architecting an application where a nurse leader would assign patients to other nurses for care assignments. This application would need to be able to support data ingests in real time and be solutioned to show at least one external ingest source that includes patient information from a hospital system. 

Nurses that were assigned by the nurse leader would be able to see all patients assigned to them in real time, and be able to make general comments, enter lab notes, and generate information to a portal where family members can communicate with the nurse, commenting back and forth.

## Nurse Leader Requirements:
1.	As a user, I need the ability to see patients that have registered into the hospitals systems
2.	As a user, I need the ability to assign patients to nurses on my staff
3.	As a user, I need the ability review information entered from staff nurses

## Staff Nurse Requirements:
1.	As a user, I need the ability read patients assigned to me
2.	As a user, I need the ability to enter lab notes, general comments, and interact with the patientâ€™s family through a family comments portal

## Family Requirements:
1.	As a user, I need to see comments made by the staff nurse assigned to my loved one
2.	As a user, I need a nurse to see comments I have made

## Tasks:
1.	Create an architecture diagram in LucidChart (free account).
2.	By using different objects in the tool, create a diagram that solutions the above requirements.

## How we will evaluate your diagram:
We will evaluate your diagram using the following methods:
1.	Examine the diagram for readability, and technology choices
2.	Examining your thought process and asking follow-up questions during our de-brief session.
3.	Reviewing any creative services, security controls, or other additions you made beyond the basic tasks & requirements.

This is your opportunity to show us your talents and skills. You are not limited to just completing the tasks above. Feel free to express yourself and add additional features & parts that you believe would be helpful to show your understanding of system design.

## Completing Time
We would appreciate if you would complete the challenge 1 week after it has been sent.
